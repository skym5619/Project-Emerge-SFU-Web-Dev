                        When I first came to the university, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I came in as a
                        Psychology major.

                        I realized after the Advanced Placement test for Psychology wasn’t for me after studying 4
                        months for the exam.

                        I then set my eyes on law, but then, I was told by my own law teacher that I was more on the
                        creative side. She said that I had the potential to be a lawyer, but I would be bored out of my
                        mind of how linear and repetitive that job would have been for me.

                        She told me I’d thrive in career where I could create things since I created beautiful works of
                        art for her classes (which she then used as samples for other classes, so I never got my
                        homework back).

                        I was always into creating things because it was a place where I could express myself freely and
                        it stemmed from the pure joy I felt when I first earned the Tawny Star (a badge for creative
                        expression) from cub scouts. I became a designer at heart, but never knew it could take me so
                        far in life. I neglected it.
